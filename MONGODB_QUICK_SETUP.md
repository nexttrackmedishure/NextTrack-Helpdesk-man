# 🚀 Quick MongoDB Setup for NextTrack Helpdesk

## ❌ Current Issue

Your user registration is not saving to MongoDB because the connection string is not configured.

## ✅ Immediate Solution (Working Now)

I've added a **fallback system** that uses your browser's localStorage. Your users will be saved locally and will appear in the User Directory table immediately.

## 🔧 To Set Up MongoDB (Optional but Recommended)

### Option 1: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Free)

1. **Go to**: [https://www.mongodb.com/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. **Sign up** for a free account
3. **Create a free cluster** (M0 Sandbox)
4. **Get your connection string** (looks like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/`)
5. **Create `.env.local` file** in your project root:

```bash
# Create this file: .env.local
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/nexttrack-helpdesk?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DB=nexttrack-helpdesk
```

### Option 2: Local MongoDB (On Your Computer)

1. **Install MongoDB**: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. **Start MongoDB service**
3. **Create `.env.local` file**:

```bash
# Create this file: .env.local
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/nexttrack-helpdesk
MONGODB_DB=nexttrack-helpdesk
```

## 🎯 What Happens Now

### ✅ With Fallback System (Working Immediately):

- ✅ **User registration works** - saves to localStorage
- ✅ **User Directory shows users** - reads from localStorage
- ✅ **Data persists** between page refreshes
- ✅ **No setup required** - works out of the box

### 🚀 With MongoDB Setup (Better for Production):

- ✅ **All localStorage features** PLUS:
- ✅ **Real database storage** - more reliable
- ✅ **Data backup** - won't lose data
- ✅ **Multi-device sync** - access from anywhere
- ✅ **Better performance** - faster queries

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

1. **Create a new user** using the registration form
2. **Check the User Directory** - user should appear immediately
3. **Refresh the page** - user should still be there
4. **Check browser console** - you'll see which storage method is being used

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ **User Registration**: Working (localStorage fallback)
- ✅ **User Directory**: Working (shows all users)
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Working (survives page refresh)
- ⚠️ **MongoDB**: Not configured (optional)
